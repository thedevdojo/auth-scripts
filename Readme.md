Make sure to update permission for the application.sh file you want to run, ex:

```
chmod +x laravel.sh
```

You'll also want to change permissions for all the additional scripts in the scripts folder:

```
 chmod -R +x scripts
 ```

Now, you can run any of the commands below to install that specific starter kit:

```
./laravel.sh
```

```
./jetstream.sh
```

```
./breeze.sh
```

```
./filament.sh
```

```
./genesis.sh
```

```
./wave.sh
```
